Prometheus metrics seems to be like that:

<metric_name> [{<label_1="value_1">,<label_2="value2">}] <metric_value>
    node_cpu_seconds_total{cpu="0",mode="idle"} 258277.86
    node_cpu_seconds_total{cpu="1",mode="idle"} 25023.77
    node_cpu_seconds_total{cpu="2",mode="idle"} 248244.36
    node_cpu_seconds_total{cpu="3",mode="idle"} 282977.22

when prometheus scarpes a target it also stores the time at which the metric was scraped as well
the timestamp is a unix timestnap - epoch (number of second that have elapsed since jan 1 1970)

Every metric has 2 attributes:
    Help - description of what the metric is
    Tyoe: what type of prometheus metric this is


Metric Types:

    1. counter - how many times did X happend. number can only increase
        mesauring total request / total job-executions / total errors

    2. Gauge - what is the current value of X - can go up or down
        Current cpu utillzation / Available system Memory

    3. Histogram - how long or how big something is.
       it allows us to group observations into configurable bucket sizes.
       Displyaing Response time by configure buckets:
        - < 1s
        - < 0.5s
        - < 0.2s
        request size by configure buckets:
        - < 1500 Mb
        - < 1000 Mb
        - < 800 Mb

    4. Summry - Similar to histograms - how many observations fell below x
       Displyaing Response time by percents:
        - 20% = 0.3s
        - 50% = 0.8s
        - 80% = 1s
