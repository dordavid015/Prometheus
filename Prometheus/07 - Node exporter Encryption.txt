we can setting up authentication and encryption in order to make our monitoring process more secure.

Authentication:
Prometheus scrape data from his targets and by default it doesnt require any authentication.
anybody which has access to our targets can scrape the metrics.


Encryption:
When prometheus scrape data from his target, if someone use sniffer and able to capture the packets - he will be able to read all of that data in plain text.
Encryption Packets will prevent the ability to see all data by using sniffing tools.


Encryption is used by using Node Exporter TLS:

1. cd node-exporter-folder

2. Creating certificate:

    sudo openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -days 3650 -nodes -x509 \
  -keyout /etc/prometheus_node_exporter/tlsCertificate.key \
  -out /etc/prometheus_node_exporter/tlsCertificate.crt \
  -subj "/CN=`hostname`" \
  -addext "subjectAltName = DNS:`hostname`"

3. Let your node-exporter using the certificate by creatin conf file:
    vi config.yml
    
    tls_server_config:
        cert_file: /etc/prometheus_node_exporter/tlsCertificate.crt
        key_file: /etc/prometheus_node_exporter/tlsCertificate.key

4. Enable NodeExporter permissions:
    chown -R /etc/prometheus_node_exporter 

5. Change NodeExporter service-File ExecStartCommand:
    vi /etc/systemd/system/node_exporter.service
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/node_exporter \
  --web.listen-address=:9200 \
  --webconfig=/etc/node_exporter/config.yaml

5. reload service:
  Systemctl daemon-reload
  Systemctl restart node_exporter

7. lets check it work:
    curl -k https://localhost:9100/metrics


8. Now we have to load the tls_crt to the prometheus_server:

    scp root:my-password@Prometheus_erver:/etc/node_exporter/tlsCertificate.crt /etc/prometheus

    chown prometheus:prometheus /etc/node_exporter/tlsCertificate.crt

9. Edit Prometheus yaml:

    vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml:

    scrape_configs:
  - job_name: "node01"
    scheme: https
    tls_config:
        ca_file: /etc/prometheus/tlsCertificate.crt
    insecure_skip_verify: true # just if we using self-certificate
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["node01:9090"]

9. Edit Prometheus yaml:
    systemctl restart prometheus
