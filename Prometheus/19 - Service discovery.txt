why do we need service discovery?

    we dont want to update manually the prometheus.yaml file every time we want to scrape new target!
    if we want to add/remove new target - we want that the file will dynamically updated as a new endpoimt will created and destoryed!

prometheus has built-in support for serval service discovery mechanisms!


File-Service-Discovery:
    a list of jobs/targets can be imported from a file this allows you
    to integrate with service discovery systems prometheus doesnt support out of the box
    supports json and yaml files



1. vim prometheus.yaml:

scrape_configs:
- job_name: 'node'
  file_sd_configs:
  - files:
    - 'targets.json'

2.Now create that targets.json file and add this content to it:
               
                target.json
[
  {
    "targets": ["localhost:9100"],
    "labels": {
        "job": "node",
        "team:" "paas"
        }
  }
]
